# PitchPerfect

The PitchPerfect iOS app demonstrates the use of UI controls (buttons, labels, stacks), IBOutlets, IBActions, Navigation View, Multiple View Controllers and some of the AVFoundation framework.

This app allows you to record your voice and play it back using several predefined effects, including slow, fast, low pitch, high pitch, echo and reverb.

PitchPerfect is the first project in the iOS Developer Nanodegree in Udacity.
